/*
* 
Hello this is a base convertion calculator written in C++ This was written by Saul Merino and John Kim. Special thanks to Erik Santana for QA checks. 

There are three options that will be given once it is called. The user is prompted to selected their option, or exit out of this calcualtor.

The user will be given a choice on what options to pick. in the first option, the user is prompted.
to enter an integer value, either positive or negative, in the decimal system. This will be stored for later use.

Note that if the user does not input an integer for calculation, then the program will prompt the user to enter one before continuing.

In the second option, the user is prompted to input a base from from binary [2], to all the way to hexatrigesimal [36]
then it will display the converted number to the appropriate base with characters and negative numbers, if needed.

In the third option, the program will automaticly calculate and display all possible  base conversions
from binary [2], to all the way to hexatrigesimal [36] in one list with the integer the user inputed.
